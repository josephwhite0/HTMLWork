My name is Joseph White and I'm on the CIT programming track. The coffee I'm drinking right now is not very good. Yet, I am going to get another cup. There are many things I enjoy and 
many things I do not...now that I think on it let me change that. There are few things I enjoy and many I do not. I could ramble on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and 
on, but I'll stop here.
